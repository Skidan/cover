					p Hello,
					p My name is Dmytro and I’m very excited by the fact that such a strong company decides to construct a new plant in Visaginas. In fact of shortage of jobs, it obviously causes a leakage of skilled workers from our town. That is why we all are appreciate for such a great opportunity to become a part of a strong company. By all the rest, it could partially revive Visaginas.
					p Considering those facts, I am thrilled to be applying for the Quality Manager role in your company. After reviewing your job description, it became clear for me that I'll surely meet your requirements and prove your expectations as well. And here’s why.
					p I’m a positive-thinking, continuously self-improving  person, always trying to do my job the best way. Over the years of my career, I’ve developed a skill that fits perfectly to the Quality Manager position that you are hiring for: a passion to optimize processes in such way that they become more efficient, consistent and clearly-looking. Even not talking about the career, optimization influences on everything in my life: from planning a family vacation trip, to my hobby (I'm a programmer enthusiast and user interfaces developer). #[br] Overall, I have consistently demonstrated conversation and organization abilities in every aspect of my Procurement Manager role at headquarter of Nova Poshta, LLC, as well as routine work with documentation, standards, directives and regulations in my current position of Technologist in Umega Group, AB. #[br] Also, I’ve made several improvements to technical documentation and optimized the procedure of EUR.1 certificate approval for customs. #[br] And now, in order to save the time and to be more specific, I invite you to review some of my achievements that you might be interested in, by watching the attached resume.
					p After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the candidate that you are looking for. I am excited to elaborate on how my proven skills and abilities will benefit your organization.
